                <p class="bd-notification is-primary">Hello! My name is Erin. I’m a recently moved psychology graduate
                    from
                    St. Louis, Missouri.
                    I now live in
                    Atlanta, Georgia with my wonderful boyfriend and two cats, Sabi and Ori. I’m a proud nerdy ambivert
                    that
                    loves historical fantasy, gaming, literature, anime, Dungeons&Dragons, drawing, self-improvement,
                    nutrition, wellness and sweets! You can easily win my undivided attention with a slice of cake. </p>

            <div class="block">
                <p>For a long time, I thought I’d be working in health for either animals or people. As a
                    child, I aspired
                    to work in veterinary medicine. After high school, I found my love for mental health and therapy,
                    and
                    thought I’d go into occupational therapy. After I graduated college, however, I found I was happiest
                    typing away code on my computer.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                <p>It’s a field that brought out my dormant creativity and love for puzzle-solving. While I
                    still love caring for both animals and people, I’m hoping a career in code will pull it together via
                    indirect work on
                    useful applications, websites and resources.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="block">
                <p>At present, I consider myself a beginner. I first learned about coding languages through
                    my boyfriend and
                    began my own learning with courses on Udemy. I enjoy working with HTML and CSS, and am still getting
                    the
                    hang of Python and Javascript. I don’t have the best memory, so it’s nice to have access to online
                    resources while I learn. I’m grateful for the opportunity to work alongside a team at DigitalCrafts
                    and
                    look forward to meeting everyone in May!
